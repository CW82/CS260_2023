Create a linked list that allows:
- An add function that takes a value and inserts it into a given position
in the list (example myList.add(someValue, somePosistion))
- A remove funtion that takes a position and removes the value stored at 
that posistion in the list and returns it (example myList.remove(somePosistion))
- A get function that takes a position and returns that value without removing it
(example myList.get(somePosition)

Tests:
- Be sure to include at least one test function for each piece of functionality 
that should verify that your code is working!  This should be at least one test
per behavior, likely more.
