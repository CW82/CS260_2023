Bag of Marbles

Properties (Variable)
1) What makes up a marble in this program?
 - a varible named marble
 - a varible for size, color, amount
 - a class named marble, then you can give the marble attibutes to desccribe it (color, how many, size, etc)

2) Behaviors (Methods)
 - A method to add or takeway from the marbles in the bag
 - A method to show how many marbles are in the bag and what they look like
 - A method for when the user tries to take a marble out of an empty bag

 I tested this by running the first two options (1 and 2) and they kind of work? I have some questions to ask to hopefully make this better.
