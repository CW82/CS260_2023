I already had VS code installed from previous classes as well as the extentions. 

5 Topics related to computing that are interesting:
- AI (specifically things like chatgtp)
- idk if this is technically computing things, but deepfakes
- Also not technically computer stuff, but two students in New Orleans figured out a new way to prove the pythagorean therom using trig
- I think the idea of mining crypocurrency is interesting
- Pointers

5 Topics I feel are difficult rn:
- Pointers
- Building AI
- Data structures
- The C/C++ language
- This is from math 232, but I thought graph theory was challenging
