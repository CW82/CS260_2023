Create some tests (at least one per function) that you want your Binary Search Tree (BST) to pass before you start coding.

Implement a binary search tree that includes:
- Nodes to store values
- An add function that adds a new value in the appropriate location based on our ordering rules,
(I likely used less than or equal to going to the left and greater than values going to the right)
- A remove function that finds and removes a value and then picks an appropriate replacement node
(successor is a term often used for this)
- We have at least one tree traversal function (I recommend starting with an in-order traversal!)
Bonus if you implement the three common traversals (pre-order, post-order, in-order)
More Bonus if you also include a breadth-first traversal (sometimes called a level-order search)
- Analyze and compare the complexity of insert and search as compared to a binary tree without any order in its nodes.
