Based on what we know about linked lists, stacks, and queues, design a queue data structure:



What functions are we likely to need for a queue to function like the one discussed in class?



What values will we need to know about the structure for our queue to function properly?



Based on what we know about linked lists, design a list data structure that allows us to add (insert) or remove (delete) values at a given location in the list (instead of the top of a stack or the front or back of a queue):



What functions are we likely to need for a list to function like this?



What values will we need to know about the structure for our list to function properly?
